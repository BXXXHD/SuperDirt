DESCRIPTION::
This is a SuperCollider variant of strong::Dirt::, the sound engine for the link::Tidal:: programming language by Alex McLean.


note::
This system is experimental, and you may encounter problems.
::


code::

// starting up

(
// configure the sound server: here you could add hardware specific options
// see http://doc.sccode.org/Classes/ServerOptions.html
s.options.numBuffers = 1024 * 16; // increase this if you need to load more samples
s.options.memSize = 8192 * 16; // increase this if you get "alloc failed" messages
s.options.maxNodes = 1024 * 32; // increase this if you are getting drop outs and the message "too many nodes"
s.options.numOutputBusChannels = 2; // set this to your hardware output channel size, if necessary
s.options.numInputBusChannels = 2; // set this to your hardware input channel size, if necessary
// boot the server and start SuperDirt
s.waitForBoot {
    ~dirt = SuperDirt(2, s); // two output channels, increase if you want to pan across more channels
    ~dirt.loadSoundFiles;   // load samples (path containing a wildcard can be passed in)
    s.sync; // wait for samples to be read
    ~dirt.start(57120, [0, 0]);
	// start listening on port 57120, create two orbits, each sending audio to channel 0.
	// You can direct sounds to the orbits from tidal e.g. by: `# orbit "0 1 1"
}
)
// now you should be able to send from tidal via port 57120

CLASSMETHODS::
method::new
Return a new instance, ready to be started

argument::numChannels
The number of channels of the internal link::Classes/Bus##bus:: (this is also the maximal number of output channels).

argument::server
link::Classes/Server:: to play on.


method::maxSampleNumChannels
Specifies the maximum number of channels your sound files have (default is 2: stereo samples)

INSTANCEMETHODS::


method::loadSoundFiles
Read a number of sound file from disk and load them into the server memory. The buffer information is also kept in link::#buffers::, a dictionary.

note::
The naming scheme works as follows:

Given a path like: code::"path/to/my/basedrum/*"::

The dictionary will contain under the key code::'basedrum':: an link::Classes/Array:: of all the link::Classes/Buffer::s from the samples found in the folder.

From tidal, they can be accessed e.g. by code::d1 $ sound $ "basedrum:1 basedrum:4"::. Sample numbers below zero or above the number of samples in the folder will wrap, i.e. if you have a folder of 4 samples, 5 will play 0.

::


argument::path
This is a string to a number of files, which usually contains a wildcard (code::*::).

argument::appendToExisting
If set to true, this will keep existing dictionary keys (see above) and add the new samples to any existing ones. This allows you to load different folders with the same name.


method::start
This method starts SuperDirt. It creates a number of link::Classes/DirtOrbit::s (each of which has global effects, output busses, and settings). It also opens a network connection.

argument::port
The port to listen on (default is 57120)

argument::outBusses

An (a link::Classes/Array::) of audio output channels: it determines how many link::Classes/DirtOrbit::s there will be.

argument::senderAddr

The program to run (a link::Classes/String::).


method::stop
End all audio processes and close network responder.
